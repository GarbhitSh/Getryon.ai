# InstaTryOn Frontend

Welcome to the **InstaTryOn Frontend** repository!  
This repo contains the frontend source code for the InstaTryOn platform — an AI-powered virtual try-on experience built to enhance online clothing shopping.

> 🚨 **Note**: This repository contains only the **frontend implementation**.  
> The backend services and machine learning models powering the try-on functionality are proprietary and not publicly available.

## 🔍 Overview

InstaTryOn lets users and businesses:
- Upload clothing items and try them on virtually.
- Mix and match styles on diverse model avatars.
- Experience realistic movement simulation.
- Integrate seamlessly into e-commerce platforms (e.g. Shopify, WordPress).

## 🧠 About the Core ML Model

Although not included in this repository, the core technology behind InstaTryOn is a set of proprietary AI/ML models designed to power realistic virtual try-on experiences. Here's an overview of what they do:

### ✨ Key Capabilities

- **Garment Segmentation**: Identifies and extracts clothing items from uploaded images.
- **Pose Estimation**: Accurately captures human poses from photos or videos for natural fitting and movement.
- **Body & Face Synthesis**: Matches clothing to diverse body types, genders, ethnicities, and age groups with photorealistic results.
- **3D Cloth Warping & Fitting**: Simulates fabric drape, stretch, and fit using AI-driven deformation techniques.
- **Motion Mapping**: Applies realistic movement to clothes using gesture/motion inference from video inputs or presets.
- **Scene & Lighting Adaptation**: Harmonizes garments and models into any background or lighting setup automatically.

### 🧠 Model Architecture (High-level)

The backend uses an ensemble of the following deep learning models and techniques:
- GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for photorealistic rendering
- Diffusion Models for pose-to-outfit generation
- CLIP-based embedding search for model-outfit matching
- Human parsing & segmentation using transformer backbones
- Custom pipeline for try-on motion generation from video frames

> These models are optimized for performance and deployed through a private cloud-based inference system with GPU acceleration.
